# CS_WritingPedagogy
This is an archive of materials used in researching approaches to including writing in undergraduate computer science education.

The materials in this folder are from a study conducted in the Fall 2022 Artificial Intelligence course offered at Elon University through the Computer Science Department (IRB ID: 23-022).

Participants completed a pre- and post-survey as well as the following assignments: 
* Two short, low-stakes assignments in which students wrote blog posts directed toward different audiences (Blog 1: non-technical, Blog 2: technical) 
* Two long, high-stakes writing activities connected to programming assignments (1: design documentation for 8-Queens implementation, 2: README, code comments, and report for final project)
